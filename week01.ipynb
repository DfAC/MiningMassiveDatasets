    "To solve for simple equations we could use [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination), but for any real life problem we need to use matrix approach, in which flow equation can be written as $r = Mr$. This is similar to eigenvector problem, where r is first egienvector (largest possible value == 1) of stochastic web matrix M (web page x links, j x i). This means we can use **power iteration** to compute r\n",
