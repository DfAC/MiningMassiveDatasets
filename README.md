# MiningMassiveDatasets

This is my **python** code, as well as the notes, for the Stanford's University Mining Massive Datasets [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/mmds).

Additional materials can be found on [their official website](http://www.mmds.org/). This also include [an electronic copy of their book]() published by [Cambridge University Press](bit.ly/1LdHGZh).
